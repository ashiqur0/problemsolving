CodeForces: A. Easy Problem
Learning: brute force, math
Description: Cube is given an integer n. She wants to know how many ordered pairs of positive integers (a, b) there are such that a = n b. Since Cube is not very good at math, please help her!

Input
The first line contains an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤99) - the number of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains an integer n (2 < n < 100).

Output
For each test case, output the number of ordered pairs (a, b) on a new line.
